# manjaro-cfg

A script for setting up the Manjaro Linux on my laptop.

### TODOs

- Allow using CLI arguments to skip the ssh key configuration
- Ask to reboot the computer to that snap will be properly configured
- cat the ssh key for a user to copy to GitHub
- I could add a script to change the wallpaper from time to time
- Keybinding to change language
